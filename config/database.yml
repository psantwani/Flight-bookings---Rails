# As with config/secrets.yml, you never want to store sensitive information,
# like your database password, in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password as a unix environment variable when you boot
# the app. Read http://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full rundown on how to provide these environment variables in a
# production deployment.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
DATABASE_URL="postgres://thhwwwxkihxlsn:F8_3D57yNo-Yj8dbqpzh6VZe8E@ec2-54-243-200-63.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d7dr42pu0iq2qt"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV['DATABASE_URL'] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: travel_app_production
  username: travel_app
  password: <%= ENV['TRAVEL_APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
